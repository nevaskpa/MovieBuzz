# MovieBuzz
 
- This android app fetches data from the [The Movie Database](https://www.themoviedb.org/) APIs to show a list of movies.
- The user can filter movies using the Genres filter in the horizontal scroll bar at the top.
- There is also the feature to search movies by tapping on the search icon in the top left corner.
- This app also supports infinte scrolling.

To try this app on your local machine, you'd need access to TMDB's API key. For this project, I have decided to keep the API key on my local `gradle.properties` file.
Add `TMDB_API_KEY=<Your_api_key>` to your local gradle.properties file to start the app locally.
